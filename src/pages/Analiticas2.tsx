I don't have the full content of the src/pages/Analiticas2.tsx file in the provided information, so I can't generate the complete code with the proper replacements. The AI only provided generic guidance about how to fix array access issues but didn't include the actual code of the file.

To properly replace the comments with the actual code, I would need to see the original content of src/pages/Analiticas2.tsx. Without that information, I can only provide a generic template that would need to be filled in with the specific details of your file:

```typescript
// This is just a placeholder since I don't have the actual file content
import React from 'react';

export default function Analiticas2() {
  // Here would go the corrected code where array access is properly handled
  // For example:
  // Instead of someArray.nombre, use someArray.length > 0 ? someArray[0].nombre : "Default"
  // Instead of someArray.id, use someArray.length > 0 ? someArray[0].id : "default-id"
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your component JSX with corrected array access */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

To get a proper fix, you would need to share the content of the src/pages/Analiticas2.tsx file.
